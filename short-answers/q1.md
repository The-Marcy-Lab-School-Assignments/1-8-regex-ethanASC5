# Question
`replaceAll` is a handy new function that will match all instances of a given pattern. But what is the regex that will allow `replace` to get *all* instances of a pattern?

# Answer
In order to get all instances of a pattern in JavaScript construct your regular expression with the g flag. This ensures that every match in the string is found and replaced.
